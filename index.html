        <h1><b>I See Fire</b></h1>
        <h4>Ed Sheeran</h4>
       <div> <p>Oh, misty eye of the mountain below <br>
            Keep careful watch of my brothers' souls  <br>
            And should the sky be filled with fire and smoke <br>
            Keep watching over Durin's sons <br> <br>
            If this is to end in fire <br>
            Then we should all burn together <br>
            Watch the flames climb high into the night <br> <br>
            Calling out father oh <br>
            Stand by and we will <br>
            Watch the flames burn auburn on <br>
            The mountain side (high) <br> <br>
            And if we should die tonight <br>
            Then we should all die together <br>
            Raise a glass of wine for the last time <br> <br>
            Calling out father oh <br>
            Prepare as we will <br>
            Watch the flames burn auburn on<br>
            The mountain side<br>
            Desolation comes upon the sky <br><br>
            Now I see fire<br>
            Inside the mountain<br>
            And I see fire<br>
            Burning the trees<br>
            And I see fire<br>
            Hollowing souls<br>
            And I see fire<br>
            Blood in the breeze<br>
            And I hope that you remember me<br><br>
            Oh, should my people fall<br>
            Then surely I'll do the same<br>
            Confined in mountain halls<br>
            We got too close to the flame <br><br>
            Calling out father oh<br>
            Hold fast and we will<br>
            Watch the flames burn auburn on<br>
            The mountain side<br>
            Desolation comes upon the sky<br><br>
            Now I see fire<br>
            Inside the mountain<br>
            And I see fire<br>
            Burning the trees<br>
            And I see fire<br>
            Hollowing souls<br>
            And I see fire<br>
            Blood in the breeze<br>
            And I hope that you remember me<br><br>
            And if the night is burning<br>
            I will cover my eyes<br>
            For if the dark returns<br>
            Then my brothers will die<br>
            And as the sky is falling down<br>
            It crashed into this lonely town<br>
            And with that shadow upon the ground<br>
            I hear my people screaming out<br><br>
            Now I see fire<br>
            Inside the mountains<br>
            I see fire<br>
            Burning the trees<br>
            I see fire<br>
            Hollowing souls<br>
            I see fire<br>
            Blood in the breeze<br><br>
            I see fire<br>
            Oh you know I saw a city burning out (fire)<br>
            And I see fire<br>
            Feel the heat upon my skin, yeah (fire)<br>
            And I see fire (fire)<br>
            And I see fire burn on and on the mountain side</p></div>
